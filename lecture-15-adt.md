# Lecture 15: ADT

Abstract data type



ADT in java: Collection \(List, Set, Map\)

maps also known as associative arrays, associative lists, symbol tables, dictionaries

## BST \(most famous and important data structure!!\)

skip list!? add random pointer to linkedlist

Tree:

1. a set of nodes
2. a set of edges that connect those nodes\(constraint: there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\)

Rooted tree: pick one node as root \(lol\)

leaf: node with no child

rooted binary tree: each node has either 0,1,2 children

BST definition: rooted binary tree with BST property

BST property: for every node x in the tree:

1. every key in the left subtree is less than x's key
2. every key in the right subtree is greater than x's key

cannot have duplicates!!!

#### inserting

#### deleting

## Sets vs maps using BST to implementation
