# Lecture 4: Node Based Lists

## IntList to SLList

private: self documenting and also enforced by compiler\(reflection will bypass this access control\) this does not provide extra sercurity for code

Nested class: private, static keyword for nested class.

private says no other class can use it, static says this nested class cannot look into its "container" class' variable, method and so on.

addFirst; addLast, removeFirst; removeLast; size; get

sentinel node make code very easy to write and think about.
